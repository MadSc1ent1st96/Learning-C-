# Learning C++

This repository contains all the C++ code files I wrote while following the [CodeWithHarry C++ tutorial playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLu0W_9lII9agpFUAlPFe_VNSlXW5uE0YL). The tutorial provides a solid foundation in C++ programming, starting from the basics and progressing to more advanced topics.

## About This Repository

- **Tutorial Source:** CodeWithHarry’s YouTube playlist
- **Number of Files:** 74 `.cpp` files
- **Purpose:** To practice and solidify C++ programming concepts by following along with the tutorial
- **Code Style:** Each file corresponds to a specific lesson or topic and is commented for clarity

## Directory Structure

- `Learning C++/`
  - `tut1.cpp`
  - `tut2.cpp`
  - `tut3.cpp`
  - `...`
  - `tut74.cpp`

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Learning-Cpp.git
2. Navigate to the folder containing the `.cpp` files.
3. Compile and run any `.cpp` file using a C++ compiler, for example:
g++ 1_hello_world.cpp -o hello_world
./hello_world
4. Explore the code and comments to understand each concept.

## Topics Covered

- Basics: Hello World, variables, data types
- Control Flow: if-else, loops, switch-case
- Functions and Recursion
- Arrays, Pointers, and References
- Object-Oriented Programming: Classes, Objects, Inheritance, Polymorphism
